    description:"My name is Stanislao Rodolfo Riccio. I grew up as a child in Seattle, Washington and then moved at a young age to the town of Spezzano Della Sila in Calabria. There, I was surrounded by my family’s traditions, one of which was making sausage, salumi, prosciutto, and other cured meats. My father, Michele Riccio, was and continues to be my mentor and the person who showed me how to perfect what we loved to make... sausage. After finishing culinary school, I began working in various Italian restaurants and soon after got married and started a family. From there I began to make sausage once again, following the family tradition, and making everything just as my father taught me. Five years later, after various attempts to perfect the recipe I am finally able to announce that one small dream has now become Riccio’s Sausage Company.",
